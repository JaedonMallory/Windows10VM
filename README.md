<h1>VirtualBox - Windows 10 Virtual Machine</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of a simple tutorial for setting up a Windows 10 Virtual Machine. It walks the user through each step of setting up a virtual machine on their desktop through VirtualBox. Virtual machines are extremely useful and can be set up very quickly. A Windows 10 Virtual Machine can be used by Linux or MacOS users that otherwise would not have access to a Windows environment. In this tutorial, it will be simulated as a non-Windows operating system, as the Microsoft website only lets you download the Windows 10 ISO file on another operating system. A tutorial on downloading the Windows 10 ISO file on a Windows machine will be provided in another repository (future link).
<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)</b> 
- <b>Windows 10 ISO (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO)</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b>

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
1. Once you have downloaded the Windows 10 ISO file and VirtualBox, Click New in VirtualBox. This prompt will ask for you to name your new Virtual Machine and ask for the ISO file you want to use.: <br/>

2. Select the Windows 10 Version you want. In this case, we are going to use Windows 10 Home:  <br/>

<br />
4. Choose how much RAM you will allocate to the virtual machine. Microsoft states that a 64x version of Windows 10 needs a minimum of 2 GB or 2048 MB. <br/>

<br />
<br />
5. This step is similar to the previous step. Choose the amount of storage your virtual machine will have access to. Microsoft states that a 64x version of Windows 10 needs a minimum of 20 GB of storage.  <br/>

<br />
6. Make sure everything is shown as you want it to be. This is the last step before creating the virtual machine.  <br/>

7. It will take a few minutes to finish installing Windows 10. Once it is done, click through the installer while following the instructions. <br/>
