<h1>VirtualBox - Windows 10 Virtual Machine</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of a simple tutorial for setting up a Windows 10 Virtual Machine. It walks the user through each step of setting up a virtual machine on their desktop through VirtualBox. Virtual machines are extremely useful and can be set up very quickly. A Windows 10 Virtual Machine can be used by Linux or MacOS users that otherwise would not have access to a Windows environment. In this tutorial, it will be simulated as a non-Windows operating system, as the Microsoft website only lets you download the Windows 10 ISO file on another operating system. A tutorial on downloading the Windows 10 ISO file on a Windows machine will be provided in another repository (future link).
